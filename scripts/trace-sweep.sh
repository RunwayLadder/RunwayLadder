# The trace sweep — a precondition for the first push to a public repository.
#
# The question this script answers: is anything left in the repository that describes
# the **author's machine** rather than the project — absolute local paths, user
# folders, keys and mnemonics.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/trace-sweep.sh          # the whole history — before push
#   scripts/trace-sweep.sh tree     # only the working copy — fast, while working
#   scripts/trace-sweep.sh ci       # the whole history, but without the identities pass
#
# # Why the history rather than the working copy
#
# After push the history is public as it is, and a line can only be removed from it by
# rewriting — i.e. by changing every hash in an already published repo. So the
# sweep goes over all revisions, and not only over file contents: a trace hides just
# as well in a commit message and in the very path of a file that once
# existed and was deleted.
#
# # Why there is a self-check
#
# Empty output comes in two kinds: "there is nothing" and "the pattern does not work".
# From outside they are indistinguishable, and the price of the second is a trace in public
# history forever. So every pattern is first run against a sample that MUST
# match; if even one does not, the script refuses to report "clean".
#
# # Why the list of personal data lives outside the repository
#
# A pattern that looks for the author's name contains that name. A script with such a line in
# a public repo would be exactly the trace it looks for. So the names are read from
# `.git/info/trace-identities` — one line per name, a file that is never
# committed. If it is missing, this pass is SKIPPED, and the script says so in
# a separate line of the summary: "clean" without such a line would mean checked, while
# it is unchecked.
